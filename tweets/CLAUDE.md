# Tweets Vault

This vault contains all Twitter/X content: drafts, ideas, and published posts.

## Identity

If you haven't seen or read @../IDENTITY.md yet, always reference @../IDENTITY.md for voice, values, and style guidelines.

## Purpose

Create tweets that challenge assumptions, share hard-earned wisdom, and make people think. Be the uncle who tells it straight.

## Workflow

1. Draft ideas in `tweets/1_drafts/`
2. Refine with the `tweet-creator` skill
3. Publish with `tweet-publisher` skill
4. Move to `tweets/2_published/` after posting
