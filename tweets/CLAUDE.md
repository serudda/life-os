# Tweets Vault

This vault contains all Twitter/X content: drafts, ideas, and published posts.

## Identity

Always reference @../IDENTITY.md for voice, values, and style guidelines.

## Purpose

Create tweets that challenge assumptions, share hard-earned wisdom, and make people think. Be the uncle who tells it straight.

## Workflow

1. Draft ideas in `drafts/`
2. Refine with the `tweet-publisher` skill
3. Move to `published/` after posting

## Content Types

- **Single tweets** - Dense, thought-provoking statements (Naval/PG style)
- **Threads** - Deep dives with real experience and opinions
- **Replies** - Engage authentically, add value or challenge

## Voice & Tone

- Direct, no filler, every word counts
- Challenge what everyone accepts blindly
- Speak from 15+ years of real experience
- Uncomfortable truths > comfortable lies
- Spanish: warmer but still direct
