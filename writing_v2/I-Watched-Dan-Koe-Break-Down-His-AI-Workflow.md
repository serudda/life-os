Transcript:
If you've been on the internet, you've
seen Danco. He's got millions of
followers and I've seen him everywhere.
So, I reached out to him and I was like,
"How do you do it?" And he told me that
his secret is LLM's, AI, and prompts.
So, in this episode, he shows his exact
playbook for coming up with ideas,
creating the content, and most
importantly, content that is going to go
viral. Now, why I find this interesting
is right now there's an unfair advantage
to create X accounts, to create YouTube
channels that get distribution. If you
can figure out distribution, you could
create a bunch of startups for those
audiences. So, if you stick around to
this end of this episode, you will
understand how to create content like
Danco. And, you know, people generally
charge thousands of dollars for this.
It's free. All I ask is for a like and a
comment on this episode. I can't wait to
see what you build. Have a creative day.
[Music]
>> What's up, Dan? Great to have you. By
the end of this episode, what are people
going to take out of it? Glad to be
here, dude. Thank you for having me on.
Uh, I have a few things to share, but
the outcome as a whole will be a big
picture overview of my content
ecosystem. So before we just started,
you were mentioning like uh you're
curious about how my output is so high
when I personally don't think it's that
high. It doesn't take too much. So uh I
think it just comes down to having a
really smart system and then being able
to augment that with AI in a unique way,
which we're going to learn. But the
other thing that we have to learn in
order to do that well is just how to use
LLMs in a way to get them to do exactly
what you want. So I'm not a coder. I
don't use too many of the fancy tools.
Mostly just claw chat GPT. So how are we
going to use the base tools that most
people have access to and understand to
create something incredible?
>> I love it. I only have one ask from you.
You know, I just ask that you don't hold
back any sauce. You give the prompts.
You show how it's really done. Because
what would be success for me is if
thousands of people consume this episode
and understand how to use LLMs to be
like you. Because when I see Dan Co, I
see millions of followers. I see you
everywhere. I see content here. I see
content there. And I'm like, how does
this guy do it? Dan, can you commit to
it?
>> Absolutely. Yep.
All right, let's get into it.
>> Cool. Uh, so the first thing there, just
to touch on, uh, millions of followers,
having so much content on so many
different platforms. The the thing about
that is all of my content is a same is
the same across all different platforms.
So the base of it all comes down to two
things. It comes down to my newsletter,
which I write every week, sometimes
twice a week, but once a week is like
baseline. And then two is two to three
social media posts a day and those are
usually written. And so I write Twitter
first because it's like the 28 280
character limit. And then since that's
like the limiting factor out of all the
platforms that can pretty easily
transfer over to any other platform. So
that gets posted to threads by
Instagram. I turn that into an image and
post that onto LinkedIn onto Instagram.
Sometimes I use them as a real script.
So I pull up my camera, look at my
phone, read my best tweet, recite it to
the camera, maybe add a bit on there.
Um, and then I have reals, Tik Toks,
shorts, etc. And the good thing about
that is since the ideas themselves are
almost always validated ideas or have
the potential to do very well, if I can
nail the first idea that goes out on
Twitter, then I'm practically nailing
all the other content that goes out on
all other platforms because I'm not much
of a trend follower. Sometimes I am, but
most of the time I believe that the
algorithms are based off of human
psychology. And if you understand human
psychology and can use AI to help you
understand that more, your content will
see a notable increase in engagement and
other things of that nature. So, uh,
first I'll just give an overview in this
canvas style so you understand my weekly
process. So, every week I plan out my
newsletter and the idea for the
newsletter.
It's based on
a a few different things. It could be a
top performing tweet of mine that I had
before because I know that that tweet
has already done well. So, I'm just
going to take on it take it expand it
into a newsletter that turns into a
YouTube video podcast. Good to go.
uh or it can be based on a video that is
already doing well on YouTube. So a good
way to generate ideas that help you grow
is to go to YouTube, look at the
accounts in your niche or the people the
kind of like tribe you want to join
online. Go to their account, go to
videos, filter by most popular, and then
just write down 10 of the videos that
you think you could recreate. Now, the
secret there is you're not watching the
videos. You're not trying to steal
anything from the video itself. You're
trying to take the topic, the angle, and
write your own perspective on it.
Because if other people are watching
those videos since they have a lot of
views, then they're going to just by the
nature of YouTube and people binge
watching things, they're going to be
recommended your video. They're going to
watch that. And if they hear you say the
same things as the other person, then
you're not going to stand out or be
unique. So that's what this process is.
So that's usually the two ways that I
come up with newsletter ideas. And I
keep a document where I tend to I just
have a list of ideas that I can pull
from. I pick the one that I think is
going to do the best that week. Now what
I do for that is I of course have a
place where I write the newsletter just
in a note or document. But I tend to
find a few things that I've either
talked about before relating to that. So
previous newsletters, previous tweets,
whatever they may be. And then Sam
Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI just
said that it is the era of the idea guy.
And he is not wrong. I think that right
now is an incredible time to be building
a startup. And if you listen to this
podcast, chances are you think so, too.
Now, I think that you can look at trends
uh to basically figure out uh what are
the startup ideas you should be
building. So, that's exactly why I built
ideabser.com. Every single day, you're
going to get a free startup idea in your
inbox, and it's all backed by high
quality data trends. How we do it,
people always ask. We use AI agents to
go and search what are people looking
for and what are they screaming for in
terms of products that you should be
building and then we hand it on a you
know silver platter for you to go check
out. Um we do have a few paid plans that
you know take it to the next level uh
give you more ideas give you more AI
agents and more almost like a chat GBT
for ideas with it but you can start for
free ideabrowser.com and if you're
listening to this I highly recommend it.
A lot of the times I like to weave in
other concepts from specific books or
videos. So this is where AI really comes
into play because I'm talking about
uh survival and how to reinvent yourself
in this newsletter. And when I say
survival, I'm talking about
psychological survival, something that I
find really unique and interesting. And
I've previously watched three videos on
that. They're each by a channel called
actualize.org
and they're like three hours long. So,
it's a lot of learning when I'm on walks
and other things of that nature that
allows me to write in-depth newsletters,
but I'm usually not taking notes during
this time. And this is where LLMs can
come into play because they can usually
pull from YouTube videos or PDFs
allowing you to talk to them and pull up
the relevant points that you want to
talk about in a newsletter. So the
research process there is thinking about
the newsletter and the topic I want to
write, talking with AI a bit and just
getting specific key points and
summaries and uh other unique
perspectives and maybe throwing in a few
things about the topic that I'm talking
about just so I have a chat that I can
refer to that
turns 6 hours of videos into a thousand
words, right? So then I can write about
it myself.
>> Uh now the other thing here is if I bake
in something I've written previously. So
this is on reinventing yourself. It's
kind of my thoughts on that. So you can
think of this newsletter as like
combining these two. So when I
take the summary, paste it into another
chat or link it to another chat, then I
can say, okay, what are the similarities
here? Is there anything that I'm
missing? I'm kind of just in this
process of ideiation with the LLM until
I feel like I have enough firepower to
start piecing together an outline and
then to start writing it. Now, I don't
have the LLM write for me, like the
actual newsletter. Um, but with what
we're going to talk about,
you could technically do that. And if we
have time, I'll actually show you how to
do that specifically. But uh that's the
research process. Nothing special here.
Just getting information from the
getting the ideas so that I can put them
into the newsletter. Otherwise, you just
get stuck staring at a blank screen.
>> So I have a question on this. So what
your thesis is basically you use X
Twitter as a litmus test on ideas.
>> Yes. And then once you have an idea that
gets validated,
then you're like, okay, this might have
legs to extend this to other mediums.
Then you
look to YouTube as a encyclopedia of
knowledge. you find popular videos
um or or videos that just are high
quality that you know might be you know
might be it might be hours long and then
you use looks like you use Gemini in the
first example to summarize it. You can
use you know really anything you want,
right?
Yeah, I I tend to go with Gemini 2.5,
especially when there's Oh, this one's
only 9 minutes, but for like the three
to six hour videos, I'll use Gemini just
because the large context window,
>> right? So, you get smart about the
videos and then from that you you extend
it, right? And you're you're not using
the LMS to at this point write it. But
um I guess my question is cuz someone
someone listening this is going to be
like
okay but you never talked about the
hardest part which is your great ideas
on Twitter. You know what I mean?
>> So
>> how do you think about that?
>> So it's kind of circular, right? The
ideas for Twitter can come from two
different places. It can come from the
newsletter itself. So I'll show over
here in a second, but they can come from
the newsletter itself and that's a good
way to generate ideas. But the mistake
that people make there is they'll have a
really good newsletter and they'll
think, "Okay, I'm supposed I'm supposed
to pull ideas from this and they'll read
a certain sentence or paragraph and just
try to copy paste that directly and post
it on Twitter with a maybe a few changes
when
in reality what you're looking for is
just the idea that you can turn into a
high performing tweet. So,
it's kind of the same thing there where
the first step is learning how to write
high performing tweets. And there's
courses on there. There's courses on
this. There's YouTube videos on this.
The best thing I can recommend is
actually what I'm going to show you, but
you need to kind of immerse yourself in
good writing and ideas. I think the best
thing you can do to write better social
content in general is to just keep a
swipe file of really good ideas that
you'd like to emulate under your own
brand. I think of brand as the ideas
that you associate yourself with. And so
you're not necessarily copying other
people's ideas or taking other people's
ideas. You're synthesizing a bunch of
different ideas that are technically
what compose your mind and your
worldview and you're bringing them
together in a very articulate way under
your own brand and then as people
consume those over time
you gain that authority in their head.
So uh that's one way to come up with
ideas is just keep a swipe file. You
have to become like a ruthless notetaker
and just consistently save ideas until
it's until you've read so many of them
and written so many of them that it's
become second nature to you on how to
just structure an idea. Like you can
give me a word and then if you give me a
minute to think about it, I could
probably come up with a really good post
about that thing.
>> And do you use any tools for that?
Um, I use, if we go to Twitter,
so I've used both Tweet Hunter X and
SuperX. It It feels like
>> a lot of people or no company has really
mastered this yet, just the Twitter
sidebar in general, where when you go to
a certain person's profile, this is the
Super X extension, and it just shows
their top performing tweets. So if you
write down five to 10 accounts that you
really like uh and you kind of want to
I think you refine your writing style by
reading the writing you aspire to have.
And so if you have the accounts that
talk like you want to talk and you
consistently visit their highest
performing tweets with SuperX or Tweet
HunterX and save all of these down and
try to exchange either the structure or
the idea and practice posting. What I
mean by that is right here there's a
clear structure. Go on more walks, walk
for no reason, walk to solve a problem,
etc., etc. You can take this structure
or bring another idea into it. So rather
than walks it could be
code
code more code every day something of
that nature. And then the more you or
that's
exchanging the taking the structure and
exchanging the idea from it. But you can
also take an idea like go on more walks
and exchange the structure of it. So
then you look at another structure where
this is just a single sentence
uh
I don't know platitude of sorts this one
at least and you can just take the idea
of walks try to write it as a single
sentence now you have two tweets from
one idea. Um, and the more you do that
and practice it, then really any idea
has the potential to do very well cuz
you can just pop it into a pre-existing
structure or you can take a structure
and plug in one of the ideas that you're
trying to include in your brand. So, uh,
one thing there that I'll talk on and
then we'll get into actually doing all
of that. Uh what the after I write the
newsletter, I have three prompts that I
like to run it through. So this first
one is just a YouTube title generator.
And I'll show you how this one's
structured. And if you do this, Greg, I
can uh put all of these in a Google doc
so people can copy paste them and read
through them and dissect how they're
structured. But for this prompt
specifically, I uh wrote a prompt. I
took my best like 15 titles on YouTube
and I
whatever I plug into it, the newsletter
I plug into it, it pulls out the key
points from that newsletter and tries to
spin them into uh 20 to 30 YouTube
titles that are similar and follow the
same psychological patterns and
principles as my best performing titles.
And so it spits these out here and then
I tend to read through these, cross out
ones that I don't think would work,
highlight ones that I think would
potentially come up with a better one
from my own mind, test that out on
YouTube. If it doesn't work after 2
weeks, I'll try changing the title.
Usually that'll get it to a decent place
in terms of views. And the reason I
create YouTube titles for this is
because
my newsletter is a practically an
outline for my YouTube videos, right? I
have it pulled up as I'm looking at the
screen, I mean at the camera. I'll look
down, read a sentence, recite it to the
camera. Sometimes I'll riff. Sometimes
I'll read straight from it. uh if I'm
looking down and reading at the
newsletter, my editor just adds B-roll
or text screens over my face so people
can't see me looking down. But that's
the general structure of it and people
quite like it. The objection there
usually is
uh well, if you're posting the same
thing on two platforms, won't people
notice that or won't they get bored?
Right?
>> And most of the time, I've seen the
opposite. Like there are people that
read it and then when they watch or
listen to it, they get something
entirely new because it's a different
medium. Other people prefer to watch or
listen rather than read. And I I just
feel like my philosophy behind it is I'd
rather produce one amazing thing a week
and just put all of my attention into
that and put it out across all platforms
rather than try to create something new
for each platform and each of those
things not be as good. And there's
probably marginal difference between the
two paths, but I've really gotten into
this flow of the weekly flow of
newsletter, YouTube video, social posts
across all platforms, and it's worked
out pretty well. People don't get angry,
and it's seems like it's working.
But the next thing I do is I'll take the
newsletter or the YouTube video and I'll
plug them into a deep post generator
prompt and just a content ideas
generator. And these are both kind of
the same thing. For the deep post
generator, I wrote a prompt that
breaks it breaks down the newsletter or
whatever you feed it. It could be a PDF,
a YouTube video, anything. And
I came up with this prompt. It's still
kind of fuzzy how I did it because it
was like a huge conversation, but I
broke down I asked it to break down a
bunch of these social posts that I
really liked. Uh the way they were
structured, the way they were written,
and the key things that made them do
really well. And after that
conversation, it said, "Okay, well, a
lot of these have paradoxes and
counterintuitive truths. A lot of them
have a transformation arc. A lot of them
have core problems. Uh, a lot of them
have examples or they handle objections
or they have action steps or
aspirational statements." And so I was
like, "Okay, take each one of these and
uh
break down the newsletter, whatever
you're fed, into like five compelling
post ideas, like the most impactful
ideas that could be turned into posts.
And then I want you to ideulate three
core paradoxes, a bunch of key quotes,
transformation arc, core problems, key
examples." So with this, I'm not asking
it to write tweets for me because the
LLM isn't going to be too good at doing
that unless you guide it to in a very
specific way. But instead here is I have
it give me the pieces of ideas like the
the
deconstruction
of high-erforming content and ideas and
just give me a bunch of those. And so I
can read through here and when one thing
sparks an idea for me, boom, I can go
and start writing a tweet on that. Or I
can combine a bunch of these together
since technically
each of these like all of these
paradoxes, quotes, problems are all
related. They're all about one idea. So
I just have a bunch of building blocks
for good content in here.
The next prompt that I use is just a
general content idea generation. And I
have it give me 60 ideas. And these are
usually based around the tweets that
have done really well for me or the
social post in general. I found that
people really like when I give harsh
life advice and I like that too. Uh
counterintuitive truths which is very
similar to the paradoxes.
core problems or pain points. Again,
very similar key insights, wisdom, big
ideas. So, I can just read through here
and I'm not technically I'm not trying
to copy paste these as a tweet. I'm just
trying to generate a starting point for
an idea so that I can
have those ideas faster, right? because
I feel like good ideas are the fuel for
content, but usually good ideas come
from sifting through hours of YouTube
videos on a walk or reading a good book
or uh read finding a really good
Substack article and having that
generate ideas or just sitting and
thinking with your thoughts until
something emerges. And those are great
ways to come up with ideas, but this is
just a way to kind of force that to an
extent and still maintain the quality
without having the LLM actually write it
for you. Now, so we just went over like
in general how I go over or how I create
my newsletters and content each week.
That's just the writing ideiation
process. How I actually structure that
on a day-to-day basis is quite simple
where I wake up, do a little morning
routine, shower, walk, whatever it may
be, and then I sit down at my computer
and the next two hours is just dedicated
to writing. So in that writing, I have
to finish one section of my newsletter
and I have to finish three posts, three
social posts. And then within that time,
you usually have time within that two
hours still to paste those social posts
to all platforms or at least schedule
them. And so that's kind of my routine
every day. It's just 2 hours of writing.
And that's the base of all of my social
media, all of my newsletter. Uh, one day
out of the week, I record my YouTube
video and pass that off to the editor.
And then boom, my content is done.
And the rest is history. You got
millions, millions of followers,
millions of likes.
Well, that that was the other thing that
I
found relatively quick is
once I had a post that started to
generate more followers than other ones
did, I knew that I just had to start
creating spin-offs of that post because
then it's like
I almost had a predictable way to
increase the follower growth. So, it's
like the the key part here is one, you
need to experiment until you kind of
strike gold and know what brings in
followers. Then you need to make that a
consistent part of your process and
consistently create spin-offs of that
while with your other time. And let's
say that's 30% of the time. That's like
one post a day out of the three. The
other two posts are for continuing the
experimentation on until you find the
next one that is like you striking gold.
Then you make that a part of your
process. Now you have two posts a day
that are just consistently most like
they they're not all going to bring in a
ton of followers, but you're getting
closer and closer to just consistently
increasing followers over time by doing
this. And if you keep that balance of
your core ideas that are consistently
going to bring in followers with a
healthy dose of experimentation until
you find more and then you just cycle
out the core ideas. That's really the
entire growth process on any social
platform in my opinion.
>> So there's there's one thing that's
missing from this which is visual assets
like media. So on X, I've noticed that
like if I tweet just words versus I
tweet words with an image, the words
with image, you know, call it performs
40% better.
Um, and so how do you think about that?
How do you think, you know, okay, you do
this process to come up with ideas to
write the content, but what do you do
about the image?
I don't do anything. But but that's just
me. Um because I've ever since I started
out, I kind of put the constraint on
myself of like I want to do this with
just writing. I I didn't start YouTube
until I think 2 years after I was on
Twitter. And
ju just by creating that constraint, it
made me be more creative and I think it
made me refine my writing a lot more.
I've occasionally incorporated visuals
in my Instagram posts uh and newsletters
for like drawing out specific concepts
or having certain infographics or I even
did animations on Instagram at one point
and those things definitely helped but
uh the animations eventually died down
because a lot more people started doing
them. And then same with the visuals.
Like I noticed they were a good pattern
interrupt when I would post those after
not posting them for a while and they
would get a lot more engagement. But
then if I tried to make that a
consistent thing, they would just
balance out as most of the posts did.
And so then I'm like, I should just
stick with writing
because the ideas in in my head, the
thing that I feel built my audience the
most, there's no way to know this, but I
think it came from
my focus on idea density and novel
perspectives. So, in my YouTube videos
especially, I try to bake in at least
one thing that I think will like blow
people's minds as an exaggeration. It's
like the thing that I found so
interesting that I feel like not too
many people know about. If I can find a
way to incorporate that into a
newsletter that has a pretty broad and
validated angle, so people go into the
video because it's already validated.
they like that topic, they'll just watch
it to watch it. And then I have a good
hook, a good lead, and then I lead them
into like that mind-blowing insight that
makes them think a bit deeper and learn
something new and have something new to
explore that gives them this unique
connection with me that
not too many other people do.
>> Yeah. I mean,
>> does that make sense?
>> It does. cuz I think like if you have
really good optimized ideas,
you don't need visuals,
it's just so hard to come up with good
ideas. I mean, you're sharing the sauce
around how to come up with good ideas,
but it it's by the way, it's not just
good ideas. It's good ideas that are
optimized for feeds,
>> right? because
>> you need people to reshare it to get
seen
um or like it or comment on it. You you
need them to stop scrolling to to you
know. So for a lot of people the images
or the videos are a bit of a crutch like
you can take a not so good idea crutch
it to a really nice visual and likely
you you'll get more seen. I think I do
think that if you added
images or and or videos to your ex
posts, you would see not that you need,
you know, another 5 million impressions
a month, but I think the way I would I
mean I think it's fun to explore like
Sora 2 just came out.
>> Um, you know, what are some short films,
cinematic films that you can, you know,
you could be creating. That's one. The
other thing is, you know, Nano Banana,
Gemini Flash 2.5,
>> you know.
Okay, I'll show you something real
quick. Actually, go to my my ex. So, I
had a um post
that
I posted that got like no like scroll,
keep scrolling. It's like a It's a lot.
It's a lot down, but I had a post um
Yeah, I'll let you know when that
basically didn't go anywhere and then I
reposted it with an image. There it is.
Stop. It went up. Went up. There it is.
The cringe mountain one. H. So, I posted
this. Everything I ever got in life was
because I climbed cringe mountain. You
sweat, you shake, you look stupid. And
then one day it breaks open and suddenly
you're the only one with the view. It
went nowhere without the, you know,
Yeah. basically nowhere without the
image, but once the image
com combined with, you know, maybe it
wasn't a great idea, maybe it was a
pretty good idea with, I think, a really
great image. It it got 148,000
impressions. And by the way, I hear you
listening to this and you're like,
"Yeah, but you have 500,000 followers or
whatever." The followers don't really
matter anymore, realistically.
>> You know, it's actually easier to get
impressions if you have less followers.
It's, you know what I mean?
>> Yeah.
>> Like I can post something that is
>> just like a throwaway tweet and it will
go nowhere. It'll get like a hundred
likes compared to a typical
2 to 3,000.
And yeah, it's just
the the audience is definitely a
force amplifier, but only if you're good
at that thing. Like if if most people
who haven't practiced writing content
for a long amount of time were given a
million followers, I do not think that
that would help them in the slightest.
>> Yeah. Cool.
>> But yeah, let's actually show a cool way
to do this with uh Claude or in in
creating a prompt to help you write
tweets or to help you, I guess, learn
how to write those high performing
posts. So, one thing I love to do is
there's a two-step process here.
Anything that I like and want to
incorporate into my work, I will ask
Claude or Chat GPT to break it down,
teach me how to do it, I will take that
as if it were a an SOP or just a set of
instructions. Then I will take a prompt
that helps me create prompts, send that,
paste the instructions into it and say,
I want to turn this into a prompt that
interviews me for the exact thing you
need in order to execute on this as best
as possible. So as an example here is I
said break down the structure of this
post so that I can recreate it from
scratch. break down why it works, the
psychological patterns involved, what
context is needed from me, and anything
else I would need to understand how to
recreate it. Then I just pasted I
believe this is one of my tweets that
did pretty good. Uh how to know you were
doing something meaningful. You feel
like you don't make any progress for
weeks, months, or years. Then the growth
hits you all at once. When you create
your own path, results aren't
predictable, and that keeps many people
from sticking with it. So, you find a
good post. Well, first you write this,
tell it to break it down. You find a
good post that you want to understand
why it did so well or how it was
written. But this can also be applied to
something like a landing page or if
you're trying to write a book and you
read someone else's book and you're
like, damn, that paragraph was good. I
want to understand how I can take my own
idea and replicate the structure of this
so my writing flows the same amount. Um,
you can do that for writing YouTube
scripts if you're able to break down the
transcript. There's just so many
different things that you can do. Uh, I
actually saw when Culie first launched,
they had a landing page that I really
liked and I copy pasted the landing
page, wrote exactly this, told it to
break down every single part of the
landing page copy and it called it
paradigm shift marketing and just taught
me exactly how to replicate it. So when
I could take that and turn it into a
prompt and then plug my own ideas for my
own product into it, then it could
rewrite that same style of copy but with
my product, my features, my problem that
I'm solving, unique mechanism, etc. So
with here uh we're breaking down a tweet
and it breaks down the core structure,
hook statement, pain and struggle, the
payoff, the insight and warning, why it
works. And just by doing this alone, you
can learn so much about writing content.
you you
like this alone is a master class in
writing one piece of content and then
you can continue conversing with it and
that helps you write better content on
your own. Then it gives you a formula
additional elements to make this work.
And then what I did here is I did the
same thing do the same thing with this
and I took one of Zack Pogra's tweet and
or Instagram posts and it was just the
best way to get your spark back is
burning everything down. You have to
reset your life. Very similar to the
things I like to read and write. And so
I like this. I want it to break it down.
I told it to. It has It broke down the
structure, provocative thesis, purge
list, the promise, the elite few, the
permission,
teaches me why it works,
writing techniques, context needed,
what makes it work, and then I did the
same thing for one last tweet. So do the
same thing with this again. People in
third People in third world countries
spend their days talking, playing,
dancing, and making love. People in
first world countries aspire to spend
their days talking, plans, playing,
dancing, and making love. I think about
this often. This was just one I found
and I'm like, that's a good idea. I'll
throw it in here, too. So, the process
of this is pretty much break down three
tweets that you really like
and then
combine all of these into a singular
guide. So now the anatomy of viral
philosophical posts a complete guide
breaks down the three archetypes which
were the tweets
and then core psychological patterns
technical structure
power techniques.
>> This is insane. This is absolutely
>> manipulation. It's it's really cool. And
like well imagine doing this for more
than just tweets like YouTube scripts
and other things like the this is where
it starts to all tie together. Once you
use this process a few you use this
process a few times you realize that you
can use it for almost anything. And then
if you rewind this podcast to looking at
the canvas that I was showing you, you
can now see that each chat in there was
one of these prompts that I created. So,
if I want to turn my newsletter into
tweets and I use this there, then it
like that's so much better than me
pasting my newsletter into an LLM and
being like, "Hey, what are 10 of the
best ideas from this? Can you write a
tweet? Have write 10 tweets for me." And
then it writes like the worst tweets
you've ever read and still includes
hashtags. So this is like how you give
the inspecific instructions so that it
can write like you or write how you want
it to and then you can paste those
directly if you'd like or you can use
those as ideas
to like as a first draft a starting
point.
Now the
last important thing here is I said from
that guide what is everything you would
need from me in order to start writing
tweets. Everything I need to know from
you. Core identity, audience psychology,
philosophical stance, voice parameters,
specific insights, transformation,
narrative, emotional territory, so on
and so forth. A lot of stuff. So, we're
making this very comprehensive
because the context is king. the the
more context you give to the AI, the
more it can get close to putting out
what you actually want it to put out or
putting out things that will blow your
mind and that you feel confident in
replicating week by week in your
content. So now we have two things here.
We have a description of the context we
need and we have instructions for how to
actually write posts. So what I did next
is I took these two things. I personally
pasted them into just a separate note
and then start a new chat.
And what I did here is I have this
special this thing is a lifesaver. I use
it all the time. It's just a prompt that
helps you create better prompts. So, uh
I can share this in some way with you
guys after, but it just it it's so good.
You just have to try it. makes very
comprehensive prompts. Um, maybe you can
pause, read through this if you'd like,
but I send that and then I try to use
the most powerful. I know 4.5 just came
out, but 4 point I use 4.1 extended
thinking on this because I just like to
be as advanced as I can when I'm
creating a specific prompt. And what I
did or said, what is the topic or role
of the prompt you want to create? I said
I want to create a prompt that helps me
ideulate social posts based on the guide
from writing posts below. Structure this
prompt in two phases. The first is
context gathering. So interview me for
the ideas that I want to write about.
And phase two is postw writing. So write
three variations of each type of post
using the ideas I gave you. Here's the
additional context. So inside of here on
this one, I didn't paste the context
that it needed from me, but I could
have. Right? In phase one, I could have
said, "Use the
uh guide on what context you need from
me in order to create interview
questions that you can ask me." And then
phase two, use the tweet writing guide
to take everything I gave you and turn
them and turn them into tweets. And so
what it did after that, sometimes this
prompt will ask clarifying questions um
if it has them to make the prompt
better.
But then it starts to spit out the
prompt and it has phase one context
gathering interview. Oh, I guess I did
paste it in there,
>> right?
>> So it's somewhere in the thing. But the
when you send this prompt for writing
tweets, it goes through it asks you what
your domain and expertise is, audience
painoint, unique observation,
transformation, vision, personal
connection,
uh what tone, specific examples, and
then once it has enough information,
it'll go into phase two, which is to
generate nine posts using uh
yeah, three variations of the patient
observer post, which was one of the
examples.
uh three variations of the dramatic
profit post, three variations of the
quiet devastator posts, post structure
requirements, constraints, output
format, and then I just had it rewrite
it as markdown without the code block so
that I could paste that into my notes
because not a coder, don't use cursor,
any of that, but I just keep things in
notes.
But, uh, Greg, do you have questions on
this?
>> What's going through my mind is like it
feels like
I've been doing content
like a Neanderl, you know? That's that's
what it feels like cuz I just I just
>> brute force my way into it, you know? I
just I have an idea and I d, you know,
and I, you know, I start typing and then
I just throw it out there. Um, it works
for me. Um, and sometimes,
you know, do what works type thing.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Um, that being said, what's going
through my mind is we we have a lot of
accounts, you know, cuz I run a holding
company and
>> I find that some of my, you know, I love
my team, but some of my team haven't
been creating content. Like, I've been
writing, you know, I started a blog 20
years ago, you know what I mean? I've
been writing for so many years that it's
just kind of uh
it's it's inst it's it's my instincts
almost now. Um so this is really helpful
for managing multiple accounts with
multiple people and you really don't
have an excuse not to be posting
something every single day if you have
this.
>> Yeah. I mean, another way to think of
it, too, is if you're a ghostriter,
social media manager, uh you're managing
clients, you can
kind of send them a prompt that gets all
of their you send it to them rather than
like a onboarding questionnaire that
pulls all of their details from them,
gets examples of their best content,
etc., etc., and then you just create
prompts for like tweets, tweet writing
for them. you create another prompt for
YouTube script writing or landing page
generation all based around their voice,
their profile, etc. And one last example
that I'll share here is you can do a
very similar thing for almost anything
where imagine I know how to create
offers. I've like been in the marketing
space for so long. But a lot of people
just starting, they have this superpower
where they can start learning by doing
faster, right? You're it's not that
you're avoiding reading a book like a
hund00 million offers by Alex Hermoszi.
You're able to get the information you
need to act and have AI act for you as a
first draft so you get the first
iteration out of the way as well. So you
can fail faster on creating your offer
so that you can refine faster. And in my
eyes, doing things this way isn't like
outsourcing your agency or your
cognition to AI. It's actually getting
you closer to being high agency and uh
learning through doing like right the
the best way to learn is by building
projects, failing, iterating, etc. So
the example here and how to turn this
into a prompt to create an offer and
start selling and failing on whatever
product it is, a SAS startup, a physical
product, a digital product, whatever. Uh
I can just ask, give me a detailed guide
on how to create offers like Alex
Horoszi. The reason we do this rather
than, hey, here's my product, help me
create an offer from it is because I
want to narrow the context from the
beginning, right? I don't want AI. I I
don't want the LLM to pull just general
context that it thinks is best for
creating an offer or writing copy. I
want it to pull from the expert that I
know has skin in the game here. So, it
gives me a detailed guide with the value
equation, building a grand slam offer,
pricing, 10x value test, naming your
offer, etc., etc.
And I think when I was doing this I cut
myself off. But what you can do here is
then I can say okay take this and
act as if you are guiding me through
creating an offer. What are the exact
steps? make it extremely detailed and
then I can do the same thing I did here
or sorry then I can ask next okay what's
all the context you need from me
uh in order to take my product and turn
it into a very good offer then it'll
spit all that out now you have two
things you have the set of instructions
and you have the context that you need
so the next thing you do is you paste
the prompt that helps you create great
prompts it's going to say what do you
want to create I say, "I want to create
a two-phase prompt. Here's the
information that you need to interview
me for." Then phase two, here's exactly
how to turn this into an offer. So, I
want you to create my offer blueprint
for me. And then you, it'll output a
prompt. You copy paste this. You send
it. You answer the questions.
It spits out an offer blueprint that is
probably 10 times better than something
you would have done on your own just
then, right? And it would probably be on
par with what you would be able to do
after
two to three months of actually learning
about it.
And I believe that is it.
Well,
you delivered, dude. I I you know that's
why I wanted to have you
>> you actually overd delivered to be
honest
>> nice
>> and because you know I think uh my mind
is just racing with how much more I can
do with content and and I you know what
are other audiences I could be spinning
up using this method. Um if you can uh
yes let's include that Google doc or or
that doc with some of this in the show
notes. Um, and I appreciate that
generosity.
Dan Co, I hope you come back on the pod.
I'll include links to where you can
follow Dan on YouTube, on X, his
newsletter. Uh, what else, Dan?
>> That's it. You'll, if you're curious,
you'll find stuff that branches off of
that.
>> Amazing. Thanks, Dan. I really
appreciate it. And uh dude, takes a lot
for me to get to get my to get my mind
buzzing, but you did. You did it.
>> Good. Yeah, I appreciate it, man. And
I'm glad that it did provide value.
That's one thing I'm always like hopeful
for because you never really know. I've
used this so much that it's like second
nature to me. So, I'm very glad. I mean,
I've used LLMs with content, like how
can you make this more clear or you know
that that kind of stuff, but I I this
the way you approach content creation is
a very methodical way of approaching
content creation. It's like very
surgical. And
um by the way, I think this is the best
way to learn how to create content. you
you might actually like everyone should
set this up.
>> Maybe over time you you you're like, you
know what, I'm just gonna now I
understand what works and what doesn't
work. I'm just going to shoot from the
hip like Greg. Um and that might be what
you what might, you know, end up being
great for you. Or you might be like,
hey, uh
I'm going to double down on this and I'm
going to make 20 accounts and that's
what this is going to look like, you And
I think I'm really interested in that
because
um I just think that we're in this
window where there's a huge o arbitrage
opportunity to earn attention. So you
know any any way to help that you know
I'm looking I'm looking for ways looking
for ways to optimize.
>> Yep. Agreed. Danco Startup Ideas podcast
thanks for coming on.
Thank you, Matt.
