# Breakdown Prompt (Dan Koe)

> Source: Video "I Watched Dan Koe Break Down His AI Workflow"

Prompt used to analyze individual tweets/posts before combining them into archetypes:

```
Break down the structure of this post so that I can recreate it from scratch. Break down why it works, the psychological patterns involved, what context is needed from me, and anything else I would need to understand how to recreate it.

[Paste post]
```

## Usage in our workflow

1. Apply this prompt to each of Sergio's top-performing tweets
2. Combine all breakdowns into a unified guide with expanded archetypes
3. Feed that guide into `prompt-generator.md` to create the CONTENT-SYSTEM.md
