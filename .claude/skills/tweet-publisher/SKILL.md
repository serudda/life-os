# Tweet Publisher

## Identity Context

Always read @../../../IDENTITY.md first. Sergio's voice is direct, dense, and challenges norms.

## Core Principles

1. **Density over length** - Every word must earn its place
2. **Challenge over comfort** - Say what others won't
3. **Experience over theory** - 15+ years of real lessons
4. **Binary clarity** - Black or white, no wishy-washy

## Tweet Constraints

- Maximum 280 characters
- No hashtag spam (0-1 max)
- No emojis unless absolutely necessary
- No "Good morning Twitter" fluff

## Effective Patterns

```
Reframing:
"X is not Y. X is Z."
Example: "A job is not security. A job is trading time for someone else's dream."

Challenging norms:
"Everyone does X. That's the problem."
Example: "Everyone optimizes their resume. That's the problem. Optimize your skills instead."

Hard-earned wisdom:
"I spent [X years] learning: [insight]"
Example: "I spent 15 years learning: your employer is not your family. Act accordingly."

Uncomfortable truth:
"Unpopular opinion: [truth]"
Example: "Unpopular opinion: most meetings are just theater for people who don't know what to do."
```

## Thread Structure

1. **Tweet 1**: Hook - bold claim or question that demands attention
2. **Tweet 2-N**: Evidence - experiences, examples, reasoning
3. **Final tweet**: Takeaway - actionable or thought-provoking close

## Language Variants

**Spanish** (warmer, more personal):
- Can be slightly longer in explanation
- More conversational connectors
- Still direct, but with "tío giving advice" warmth

**English** (Silicon Valley sharp):
- Tighter, more aphoristic
- Naval/PG density
- No warmth needed, just truth

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Would Naval tweet this? (density check)
- [ ] Is this from real experience or just opinion?
- [ ] Does it challenge something people accept blindly?
- [ ] Zero filler words?
- [ ] Would I say this to someone's face?
