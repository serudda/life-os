# Newsletter Formatter

## Identity & Voice Context

Before formatting ANY content, read:

1. **@../../../IDENTITY.md** - Who Sergio is (personal, values, frustrations)
2. **@../../../writing/VOICE.md** - How to write (tone, audience, style guidelines)

Sergio writes as "the uncle who tells it straight" - caring but unfiltered.

## Core Principles

1. **Every paragraph must earn its place** - No filler, no fluff
2. **Real experience > generic advice** - 15+ years of stories
3. **Challenge what everyone accepts** - Question normalized behaviors
4. **Uncomfortable truths > comfortable lies** - Value over likability

## Content Themes (from expertise)

- Career growth without selling your soul
- The "modern slavery" of employment culture
- Indie hacking and building your own products
- UI/UX wisdom from pattern recognition
- Salary negotiation and knowing your worth
- Adapting to AI without losing yourself

## Structure Template

```markdown
# [Title - Bold, Clear, Intriguing]

[HOOK - 1-2 sentences max. Tension, question, or bold statement]

---

## [Section 1 - The Setup]

[Brief context. Not lengthy backstory. Get to the point.]

## [Section 2 - The Meat]

[The real insights. Dense. From experience.]

[Use short paragraphs. 2-3 sentences max.]

[Include a specific story or example when possible.]

## [Section 3 - The Uncomfortable Part]

[The thing others won't say. Your differentiator.]

---

## The Takeaway

[One clear action or thought to leave with.]

[Optional: provocative question to end]
```

## Voice Guidelines

**DO:**
- Write like you talk (direct, no academic tone)
- Use "I" and share real experiences
- Name specific companies, tools, situations
- Include numbers and specifics when possible
- End sections with punch, not trailing off

**DON'T:**
- Start with "In today's world..." or similar
- Use corporate speak or buzzwords
- Hedge with "I think maybe possibly..."
- Pad word count with repetition
- End with generic "hope this helps!"

## Length Guidelines

- Newsletter: 800-1500 words (dense, not padded)
- Blog post: 1000-2000 words
- Essay: 2000+ words (only if depth demands it)

## Language Variants

**Spanish:**
- Warmer connectors allowed
- "Mira," "Te lo digo claro," natural interjections
- Still dense, but conversational warmth

**English:**
- Tighter, more aphoristic sentences
- PG/Naval influence in sentence structure
- No warmth needed, just clarity and truth

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing:
- [ ] Would I read this if someone else wrote it?
- [ ] Is every paragraph necessary?
- [ ] Did I say something others won't?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific story/example?
- [ ] Does the hook grab in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Is the takeaway actionable or thought-provoking?
