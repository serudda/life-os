# Tweet Creator

## Purpose

Transform raw ideas into dense, challenging tweets that sound authentically like Sergio.

## Identity Context

**CRITICAL**: Before creating ANY tweet, read @../../../IDENTITY.md to absorb:
- Archetype: "The uncle who tells it straight"
- Core values: Justice, honesty, reciprocal loyalty
- Frustrations: Modern slavery illusion, injustice
- Voice: Direct, dense, no filler, challenges norms
- Experience: 15+ years in tech, indie hacker, startup mercenary

---

## Main Workflow

When user shares a raw idea:

```
Step 1: ABSORB CONTEXT
        → Read @../../../IDENTITY.md completely
        → Understand the user's raw idea and core message
        → Identify which value/frustration/experience connects

Step 2: ANALYZE THE IDEA
        → What is the CORE truth?
        → What norm or assumption does this challenge?
        → What would Naval/PG/Levelsio say about this?

Step 3: TRANSFORM (not just translate)
        → Apply binary thinking: make it black/white
        → Remove ALL filler words
        → Add the uncomfortable truth angle
        → Use effective patterns if they fit naturally
        → Respect the original idea but elevate it

Step 4: GENERATE OPTIONS
        → Create 2-3 draft versions with different angles:
          - Version A: Most direct/confrontational
          - Version B: Question-based (engagement)
          - Version C: Personal experience angle
        → Show character count for each

Step 5: USER SELECTS
        → User picks favorite or requests adjustments
        → Iterate until satisfied

Step 6: SAVE DRAFT
        → Ask: standalone or part of a series?
        → Save to tweets/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md (standalone)
        → Or tweets/drafts/series/[series-name]/NN-topic.md (series)
        → Confirm file created
```

## The Sergio Filter

When transforming, ask:

1. **Is this dense enough?**
   → Can I remove any word without losing meaning?
   → Naval test: Would this fit his timeline?

2. **Does this challenge something?**
   → What assumption does society accept that this questions?

3. **Is this from experience?**
   → Can I anchor this to 15+ years of real work?

4. **Is this binary?**
   → Make it black/white, remove hedging

5. **Would Sergio say this to someone's face?**
   → If not, it's not honest enough

## Transformation Examples

**Raw**: "Creo que la gente debería aprender a decir que no en el trabajo"

**Transformed**:
> Decir "sí" a todo en el trabajo no te hace comprometido.
> Te hace reemplazable.
>
> Los que dicen "no" son los que saben su valor.

---

**Raw**: "Me molesta cuando la gente no es directa conmigo"

**Transformed**:
> Prefiero que me digas que te caigo mal a que finjas que no.
>
> La honestidad incómoda es respeto. La amabilidad falsa es desprecio.

## Effective Patterns

```
REFRAMING
"X is not Y. X is Z."

CHALLENGING NORMS
"Everyone does X. That's the problem."

HARD-EARNED WISDOM
"[X años] me enseñaron: [insight]"

UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH
"Unpopular opinion: [truth]"

BINARY CONTRAST
"X: [def]. Y: [def]. La diferencia: [insight]"

DIRECT QUESTION
"¿[Uncomfortable question]? Eso es [reframe]."
```

## Voice Variants

### Spanish (@serudda_es)
- Warmer: "Mira,", "Te lo digo claro:"
- "Tío giving advice" energy
- Still dense, still direct

### English (@serudda)
- Silicon Valley sharp
- Naval/PG aphoristic
- No warmth, just truth

## Constraints

- Maximum 280 characters (HARD LIMIT)
