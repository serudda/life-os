# Life SO - Personal Operating System

This project organizes different areas of my life into independent "vaults", each with its own context and purpose.

## Creator Identity

- **@IDENTITY.md** - Who Sergio is (personal profile, values, frustrations)
- Each vault has its own **VOICE.md** with tone, audience, and style guidelines

## Active Vaults

- **writing/** - Content creation for newsletter and blog
- **tweets/** - Thoughts and posts for Twitter/X

## General Conventions

- Each vault has its own CLAUDE.md with specific instructions
- Drafts go in `drafts/`, published content in `published/`

## Available Skills

Skills are located in `.claude/skills/` and activate automatically based on context.
