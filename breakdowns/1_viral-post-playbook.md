# The Viral Post Playbook

A unified guide to writing posts that resonate—from long-form essays to single-sentence aphorisms.

---

## The Core Insight

All three posts do the same thing at different scales:

> **Name something the reader already feels but hasn't articulated, then give them a frame that makes them feel smarter for noticing it.**

The difference is just _how much work you do_ versus _how much work you leave for the reader_.

## The Spectrum

| Format         | Length        | Your role | Reader's role | Goal     |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------- |
| **Long-form**  | 200-400 words | Teacher   | Student       | Empower  |
| **Micro-post** | 30-50 words   | Observer  | Witness       | Validate |
| **Aphorism**   | 10-25 words   | Oracle    | Interpreter   | Flatter  |

As posts get shorter:

- You do less explaining
- The reader does more projecting
- The tone shifts from helpful to knowing
- The credibility comes from compression, not evidence

## Universal Psychological Principles

These work across all three formats:

### 1. Name the Unspoken

Every effective post articulates something the reader has felt but not said. The reaction you want: _"I've thought this but never put it into words."_

### 2. Create an In-Group

Position the reader as someone who "gets it"—whether through tribal identity ("developers"), social proof ("your smartest friends"), or shared experience ("you had to survive").

### 3. Assign a Villain (or Force)

Something external must be responsible for the problem:

- Long-form: society, parents, school, "the default path"
- Micro: companies, institutions, "they"
- Aphorism: implied (the masses who dismiss "crazy" ideas)

### 4. Flatter Without Being Obvious

The reader should feel intelligent for reading your post:

- Long-form: "You can wake up from the programming"
- Micro: "You noticed something others haven't"
- Aphorism: "You have smart friends and can recognize shifts"

### 5. Close Escape Hatches

Anticipate how readers might exempt themselves and block it:

- "Even if your routine is 'not having a routine'"
- "I don't know if it's good or bad" (preempts moral debate)
- "Your _smartest_ friends" (can't dismiss as fringe weirdos)

### 6. Control Closure

Decide whether to resolve tension or leave it open:

- Long-form: resolves (here's what to do)
- Micro: leaves open (here's what's happening, good luck)
- Aphorism: leaves open (here's what to watch for)

Open loops drive shares. Closed loops drive saves.

## Format 1: Long-Form (The Teacher)

### Purpose

Guide the reader from problem to solution. They should finish feeling _equipped_.

### Structure

```
1. HOOK — Provocative reframe (1 line)
2. EMPATHY — Blame displacement ("not your fault") (1 paragraph)
3. DEFAULT PATH — Articulate the unconscious script (1 paragraph)
4. REFRAME — Close escape hatches, raise stakes (1 paragraph)
5. SOLUTION — Practical steps framed as experiments (1-2 paragraphs)
6. GROUNDED CLOSE — "That's all there is to it" energy (1-2 sentences)
```

### Key Moves

| Section      | What to do                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hook         | State something inevitable that feels like a choice         |
| Empathy      | Externalize blame to systems, childhood, society            |
| Default path | Use rhythmic listing to mimic monotony                      |
| Reframe      | "The thing you're avoiding? You're already doing it badly." |
| Solution     | Concrete but flexible; "experiment," not "you must"         |
| Close        | Lower the stakes; make it feel achievable                   |

### Template

```markdown
**[Provocative claim framing something as inevitable]**

[Empathy: blame systems/childhood/society. "It's not your fault."]

[Default path: the script everyone follows. Rhythmic, slightly mocking.]

[Reframe: they're already doing the thing, just unconsciously. Stakes are high.]

[Solution: vision → goals → experiments. Flexible, not rigid.]

[Grounded close: "That's all there is to it." / "Start today."]
```

### Tone

Warm, confident, slightly world-weary. You've seen the trap and escaped it. Now you're back to help.

---

## Format 2: Micro-Post (The Observer)

### Purpose

Name a dynamic and walk away. They should finish feeling _seen_.

### Structure

```
1. CLAIM — Villain + victim + verb (1 line)
2. EVIDENCE — Specific tactics that trigger pattern recognition (1 line)
3. DETACHMENT — Strategic ambiguity + resignation (1 line)
```

### Key Moves

| Section    | What to do                                                                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claim      | Loaded verb (exploiting, manipulating, pressuring) + abstract villain + specific victim tribe |
| Evidence   | Three concrete specifics the reader experiences daily                                         |
| Detachment | "I don't know if it's good or bad" / "It's just reality"                                      |

### Template

```markdown
[Villain] is [exploiting/manipulating/pressuring] [tribe]'s fear of [anxiety].

They use that to [tactic], [tactic], and [tactic].

I don't know if it's [good or bad], but it's [the reality we're in].
```

### Tone

Detached, observational, slightly resigned. You're not here to fix it. You're here to name it.

### Why the Detachment Matters

- Disarms critics ("I'm not even saying it's bad")
- Sounds more credible than moralizing
- Creates shared helplessness → bonding
- Leaves tension unresolved → more engagement

---

## Format 3: Aphorism (The Oracle)

### Purpose

Drop a compressed insight and disappear. They should finish feeling _initiated_.

### Structure

```
1. CONDITIONAL — "If [unexpected signal]..."
2. IMPERATIVE — "...[short command]."
3. IMPLICATION — "[Grand consequence] may be [happening]."
```

Or even simpler:

```
[When/If] [credible source] [does unexpected thing], [big event] [is near/is underway].
```

### Key Moves

| Element     | What to do                                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signal      | Something dismissed as noise that's actually signal                                |
| Source      | High-credibility person or group (smartest friends, experts, skeptics)             |
| Command     | Two words. Imperative. ("Pay attention." / "Listen closely." / "Watch carefully.") |
| Implication | Grand term: paradigm shift, inflection point, phase change                         |

### Template

```markdown
If [high-credibility people] start [doing something that seems wrong] — [two-word imperative].

[Grand event] may be [underway/coming/near].
```

Or:

```markdown
When [unexpected behavior] from [credible source], [grand implication].
```

### Tone

Cryptic, confident, unhurried. You've seen patterns others haven't. You're offering a lens, not an explanation.

### Why It Works

- Reader supplies their own examples (confirmation bias does your work)
- Compression = authority (sounds like it's been refined over years)
- Flattery by implication (you're smart enough to use this heuristic)
- Unfalsifiable (no specific claim to argue against)

## Shared Craft Elements

### Hooks That Work

| Type                   | Example                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inevitable binary      | "If you don't X, you'll be assigned X"                  |
| Villain + victim       | "[Group] is exploiting [group]"                         |
| Signal inversion       | "If [weird thing], [big thing]"                         |
| Counterintuitive claim | "The most productive thing you can do is stop trying"   |
| Definition challenge   | "You already have a routine, you just didn't design it" |

### Closers That Work

| Type                 | Example                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Grounded simplicity  | "That's all there is to it."                  |
| Resigned observation | "It's the reality we're living in."           |
| Implied action       | "Pay attention."                              |
| Open question        | "What are you building without realizing it?" |
| Permission grant     | "Start with what you know."                   |

### Rhythm and Brevity

- Use short sentences for punch.
- Use fragments for emphasis. Like this.
- Three-item lists feel complete: "estimates, deadlines, and criticism"
- One-line paragraphs create scroll momentum.

### Strategic Vagueness

Leave room for the reader to insert their own experience:

- "Crazy things" (what things? reader decides)
- "Pressure" (what kind? reader fills in)
- "What you want out of life" (you don't define it)

The more specific your structure and the more vague your content, the more universally it resonates.

## The Meta-Formula

Underneath all three formats is one move:

```
[Name a felt-but-unspoken tension]
     +
[Provide a frame that explains it]
     +
[Position the reader as someone who can see it now]
```

Everything else—length, tone, structure—is just packaging.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before posting, ask:

- [ ] Does this name something people feel but haven't said?
- [ ] Is there a clear in-group (who this is for)?
- [ ] Is there an external force to blame or observe?
- [ ] Does the reader feel smarter after reading this?
- [ ] Have I closed the escape hatches?
- [ ] Is the tension resolved (long-form) or left open (micro/aphorism)?
- [ ] Is every sentence necessary?
- [ ] Does the hook work in isolation (for previews/screenshots)?

---

## Final Note

These formats are not formulas to follow mechanically. They're _patterns_ extracted from posts that worked.

The best posts come from genuine observation. The frameworks just help you _package_ observations you've already had.

Start with something true. Then compress it until it's undeniable.
