## Personality Profile

### Superpowers

1. **Obsessive execution** - Locks onto a goal and sacrifices everything until it's done
2. **Binary thinking** - Black or white, no gray. Decisive, fast, clear
3. **Visual precision** - Spots misaligned pixels, inconsistent spacing, icon size mismatches instantly. "My eyes cry when something is off"
4. **Direct communication** - No filters, says things as they are

### Shadow Side

- Can damage relationships by prioritizing objectives over people
- Directness can be perceived as offensive (unintentionally)
- Struggles to understand why others accept things he finds absurd

### Zodiac Context

Aries - Direct, impulsive, competitive, leadership-oriented

---

## Core Values (Non-negotiable)

### 1. Justice & Impartiality

Will choose objectivity over loyalty to family, partner, or friends. If someone is wrong, they'll hear it—regardless of relationship.

### 2. Honesty & Sincerity

Expects direct feedback. "If you don't like me, tell me. If you do, tell me."

### 3. Reciprocal Loyalty

> "If you value me, I'll value you twice as much. If you don't value me, I'll value you far less than you value me."

---

## Deep Frustrations

### The Modern Slavery Illusion

Can't understand why society normalized employers "owning" your time. Being contacted at 9pm or weekends because "they're your boss" feels like ownership, not employment. Feels like "the crazy one" for questioning what everyone accepts.

### Injustice

Seeing people take sides based on affinity rather than truth. Values objectivity even when it creates conflict.
