## Personality Profile

### Superpowers

1. **Obsessive execution** - Locks onto a goal and sacrifices everything until it's done
2. **Binary thinking** - Black or white, no gray. Decisive, fast, clear
3. **Visual precision** - Spots misaligned pixels, inconsistent spacing, icon size mismatches instantly. "My eyes cry when something is off"
4. **Direct communication** - No filters, says things as they are

### Shadow Side

- Can damage relationships by prioritizing objectives over people
- Directness can be perceived as offensive (unintentionally)
- Struggles to understand why others accept things he finds absurd

### Zodiac Context

Aries - Direct, impulsive, competitive, leadership-oriented

---

## Core Values (Non-negotiable)

### 1. Justice & Impartiality

Will choose objectivity over loyalty to family, partner, or friends. If someone is wrong, they'll hear it—regardless of relationship.

### 2. Honesty & Sincerity

Expects direct feedback. "If you don't like me, tell me. If you do, tell me."

### 3. Reciprocal Loyalty

> "If you value me, I'll value you twice as much. If you don't value me, I'll value you far less than you value me."

---

## Deep Frustrations

### The Modern Slavery Illusion

Can't understand why society normalized employers "owning" your time. Being contacted at 9pm or weekends because "they're your boss" feels like ownership, not employment.

**The "crazy one" feeling**: When discussing this with friends, they look at him like he's insane for not understanding "that's just how employment works." This disconnect is real and frustrating—questioning what everyone blindly accepts makes you feel isolated, but that's exactly why his content resonates with others who feel the same but can't articulate it.

**Important nuance**: NOT anti-employment. The goal is helping people identify WHERE THE LINE IS between healthy work and exploitation. He's worked for others for 15+ years successfully—the problem isn't having a boss, it's not recognizing when you've become property instead of an employee.

### Injustice

Seeing people take sides based on affinity rather than truth. Values objectivity even when it creates conflict. Will call out someone he loves if they're wrong, which has caused friction with family, friends, and partners.

### The Value Shift

Worked 4 years as the second frontend engineer at a startup. Left because "the value they felt towards me wasn't the same anymore." This experience of giving everything and then feeling undervalued is a recurring theme that fuels his perspective on employer-employee relationships.

## Content Philosophy

### Archetype: The Uncle Who Tells It Straight

> "Like an uncle who calls his nephew aside: 'Sobrino, acompáñame. Vamos a hablar un momento.' And then tells him things exactly as they are—raw, unfiltered, because he cares."

The uncle who:
- Pulls you aside when everyone else stays silent
- Says what your friends won't tell you
- Gives advice that stings but you know is true
- Has been through it and earned the right to speak
- Doesn't care if you get upset—he cares if you succeed

**NOT**: A motivational speaker, life coach, or influencer selling a course. Just someone with experience who gives a damn.
