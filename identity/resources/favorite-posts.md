Companies are exploiting developers’ fear of being replaced by AI.

They use that insecurity to pressure estimates, deadlines, and criticism.

I don’t know if it’s good or bad, but it’s the reality we’re living in.

**if you don't create a routine, you will be assigned one**

People are too quick to adopt the structure that somebody else created to ease life's uncertainty. But it's not entirely your fault. You didn't know any better as a child. You had to survive. You had to learn from your parents who probably had a rigid and narrow worldview. You had to go to school. You didn't know how to filter the information that formed the web of beliefs in your mind.

The only potential you were aware of is the one that everyone else did. Get the job. Get the house. Get the spouse. Pay the bills. Stay on autopilot and pray that one day you can retire and finally be happy. This is the "safe" and "secure" route that shaped the routine of habits you have right now.

The solution to a boring, repetitive, and robotic life is to change the direction of your life. You need a routine. And if you think you don't, you may not realize that you already have one, even if your routine is "not having a routine" or "going with the flow." Routines are the programs your mind operates on to achieve a specific goal. The habits that form your current routine are creating your future in real time. So if you want to stop building the dreams of others and start building your own, you need to launch into the unknown.

Start with a vision for your future. Get clear on what you want out of life. If you don't know what that is, get clear on what you don't want out of life. It's much easier to know what you don't want through reflection, observation, and experience. From there, a rough image starts to form of what you do want. Start with what you know and refine it with experience as you discover new potentials for your life. Then, reverse engineer that vision into clear goals. Understand that goals are for clarity and direction. Their sole purpose is to help you make better decisions. Don't become a slave to them.

Now, experiment with new routines. Write them out. Try deep work blocks, long walks, exercise, or extended periods of spontaneity and rest (yes, those fall within a routine). Then, do it, and when you notice problems, improve the routine, let your goals evolve, and repeat the process. That's all there is to it.

Visit all the places, eat all the food, read all the books, make all the friends, gather all the fame, support all the causes, build all the products, earn all the money...

...to see that the quality of your life is what it is when you are doing nothing.
