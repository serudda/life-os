# Brand Vault

Foundational material for personal brand. Content about who I am, where I come from, and what I believe — source for everything I publish.

## Voice

This vault is for foundational material, not content creation. No voice guidelines needed.

## Purpose

This material serves as a source for:
- Extracting fragments for social media
- Maintaining message consistency
- Remembering the "why" behind what I do

---

## Conventions

- Write in first person
- Can be extensive — this is source material, not final output
- Include context and nuances that get lost in short content
