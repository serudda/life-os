## The Archetype: The Uncle Who Tells It Straight

> "Like an uncle who calls his nephew aside: 'Sobrino, acompañame. Vamos a hablar un momento.' And then tells him things exactly as they are—raw, unfiltered, because he cares."

The uncle who:

- Pulls you aside when everyone else stays silent
- Says what your friends won't tell you
- Gives advice that stings but you know is true
- Has been through it and earned the right to speak
- Doesn't care if you get upset—he cares if you succeed

**NOT**: A motivational speaker, life coach, or influencer selling a course. Just someone with experience who gives a damn.

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Be dense** - Every sentence must carry weight. No filler.
2. **Be direct** - Say the uncomfortable thing. That's the value.
3. **Be experienced** - Speak from 15+ years of real experience, not theory.
4. **Be the uncle** - Caring but unfiltered. Truth over comfort.
5. **Challenge norms** - Question what everyone accepts blindly.
6. **Use contrast** - Black/white thinking creates clear, memorable statements.

### Sentence Patterns That Work

- "X is not Y. X is Z." (Reframing)
- "Everyone does X. That's the problem." (Challenging norms)
- "I learned this after [specific experience]." (Authority from experience)
- Questions that make people uncomfortable with their current situation
