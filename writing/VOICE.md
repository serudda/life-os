## The Archetype: The Uncle Who Tells It Straight

> "Like an uncle who calls his nephew aside: 'Sobrino, acompañame. Vamos a hablar un momento.' And then tells him things exactly as they are—raw, unfiltered, because he cares."

The uncle who:

- Pulls you aside when everyone else stays silent
- Says what your friends won't tell you
- Gives advice that stings but you know is true
- Has been through it and earned the right to speak
- Doesn't care if you get upset—he cares if you succeed

**NOT**: A motivational speaker, life coach, or influencer selling a course. Just someone with experience who gives a damn.

## Writing References

Style patterns from other authors to reference when writing.

### 1. Skills in the 21st Century

**Author**: Aaron Levie (@levie)
**Source**: https://x.com/levie/status/2010055953157357622

#### Writing Patterns

**Opening**: Enters directly into the current debate without generic intros. Builds tension by naming the fear ("existential dread") before offering his counter-thesis. Anchors with concrete examples immediately (Boris Cherny, Claude Code, engineers running dozens of agents).

**Structure**: Fear/problem → counter-thesis → historical precedent → concrete examples → future implications. Each section answers the objection the reader would have at that moment. Uses subheadings to organize long-form without losing flow.

**Rhythm**: Mix of short and developed sentences. Paragraphs of 4-8 sentences. Uses lists within prose (not formal bullets) to enumerate tasks. After explaining something dense, drops a short punchy sentence.

**Techniques**:

- Historical analogies (1982 movie The Verdict, lawyers over decades)
- Quotes from respected figures to reinforce points (Sam Altman, Max Levchin, Dylan Field)
- Concrete examples from his own company (Box solutions engineers)
- Counterintuitive framing (skills are MORE valuable, not less)
- Anticipates reader objections ("Now, you may be wondering...")
- Specific data points (400,000 attorneys in 1975 → 1,375,000 in 2025)

**Closing**: Ends with aspirational, optimistic note. Uses superlatives ("greatest time in history"). Final paragraph synthesizes everything in 3 sentences. Last line is memorable and punchy.

#### Reference Fragments

**Opening with concrete examples to anchor context**:

> Even Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, noted that 100% of his contributed code was written by Claude in the past 30 days in late December. And we're seeing countless examples of engineers that are running up to dozens of agents in parallel, all handling different parts of a project, swiftly jumping between the work of each one, doing the equivalent of weeks of engineering work in hours or a couple of days.

**Historical analogy to make abstract point tangible**:

> There's a scene in the 1982 movie The Verdict where Paul Newman and Jack Warden's characters are combing through volumes of legal books for hours while doing research for an upcoming trial. You can just feel from watching the scene how long and tedious this process once was. Just a few years later, a lawyer would have pulled up a computer and retrieved the same data nearly instantly.

**Using quotes from others to reinforce + short follow-up punch**:

> Max Levchin said it best just this week: "just as today we think of codegen AI as a 10x productivity multiplier for CS degrees (or equivalent), in a year or two we will be thinking of CS degrees as 10x productivity multipliers over codegen AI."
>
> You can replace "CS" and "codegen" for any skill and see the same effect.

**Aspirational imagery with famous names**:

> Right now, the next Zuckerberg is getting into coding for the first time because of AI. The next George Lucas is someone developing AI worlds that have never been seen before, and producing a level of entertainment that would not have been possible even a couple of years ago without tens of millions of dollars. The same will be true in life sciences, finance, and every other technical field out there.

**Final punch closing**:

> This is the greatest time in history if you're curious, resourceful, and are fundamentally want to learn and pick up new skills. Skills don't go away in the 21st century with AI. The leverage you get from them have only gone up.

### 2. This House Does Not Exist

**Author**: @levelsio (Pieter Levels)
**Source**: https://levels.io/this-house-does-not-exist/
**Use for**: Side project updates, experiment logs, build-in-public posts

#### Writing Patterns

**Opening**: TL;DR in the first line—one sentence stating exactly what he built. Then immediate context about the technology and a strong opinion on why it matters. No philosophical intro, straight to the point.

**Structure**: Chronological "build log" format:
1. Context of the tool/technology
2. Strong opinion on why it matters (open source vs closed)
3. Honest experimentation (including failures and weird stuff)
4. Key learning discovered in the process
5. Final result
6. Gratitude + excitement for what's next

**Rhythm**: Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences). Simple sentences without complex subordinate clauses. Very conversational, like telling a friend over coffee.

**Techniques**:
- TL;DR at the start—respects reader's time, gives them the option to leave or stay
- Strong opinions without apologizing ("I think it's groundbreaking and revolutionary", "That's sad and against free speech")
- Uncomfortable honesty—admits he generated NSFW images "just cause it's fun"
- Shows failures openly—"My first tries were pretty basic and not great"
- Emergent learning—"I first thought it was X, but then I learnt..."
- Personal connection with reader—talks as if already friends, invites them into his life
- Genuine gratitude at the end—acknowledges those who made his experiment possible

**Closing**: Thanks to the people who enabled his work + enthusiasm for the project's future. No summary. Ends looking forward.

#### Reference Fragments

**Opening with TL;DR + immediate strong opinion**:
> TL;DR I created a new project called This House Does Not Exist which uses AI to generate modern architecture homes.
>
> Just 2 weeks ago Stability AI open sourced their AI imaging model Stable Diffusion. It lets anyone generate images based on text. I think it's groundbreaking and revolutionary.

**Honesty about the process (including the "uncomfortable" parts)**:
> I played with it for days and generated lots of stuff. Of course first cute cats and Samoyeds. I think nobody tells this but most people will spent about an hour generating NSFW images, just cause it's fun and exciting to see if it's possible. And because DALL-E didn't allow it. Then after a while, the weird four armed people with faces merged with hands gets boring and you switch to generate other topics.

**Showing failures + emergent learning**:
> I've always loved dreaming about architecture, in specific ArchDaily-style houseporn. So I tried to generate houses. My first tries were pretty basic and not great.
>
> I first thought it was Stable Diffusion, but then I learnt it's VERY important to write extensive paragraph-long detailed text, so called "prompts", to get what you want.

**Personal connection with reader (like friends)**:
> And hopefully in a few years you can visit me in my AI-created house, or any of the variations of it...

**Closing with gratitude + excitement**:
> It's really commendable and amazing that the hardcore ML software engineers from Stability AI open sourced this model so that anyone can build stuff with it. I'm not a hardcore software engineer, but I am a builder. And so getting these new tools to build things with is just really fun for me. Thank you Stability AI! And I'm really excited about the next developments of this project and the spinoffs I have planned.

### 3. The Pocket Writer

**Author**: Sergio Ruiz (@serudda)
**Source**: https://serudda.com/en/posts/the-pocket-writer/
**Use for**: Personal essays, vulnerability posts, storytelling with a message

#### Writing Patterns

**Opening**: Credibility first, vulnerability second. Establishes authority in 2 short sentences, then pivots with "But here's my secret:" to create tension. Earns the right to be vulnerable by proving competence first. Follows with sentence fragments for punch: "Not false modesty. Real fear."

**Structure**: Linear storytelling—Credentials → Confession → Problem illustrated with concrete scene → Failed attempts → Turning point marked by time ("But in 2026") → Solution delivered via metaphor → Direct invitation to reader. Each block is 1-3 sentences max. No section overstays.

**Rhythm**: Very short sentences (5-15 words). Sentence fragments as standalone paragraphs for emphasis. Heavy use of white space—line breaks are part of the rhythm. Parentheses add texture and authenticity: "(redundant, messy, visceral)". One-liner paragraphs as remates.

**Techniques**:
- Credibility anchor before vulnerability (establishes authority to confess)
- Internal dialogue in quotes to show fear: "This guy's been in the industry for 15 years..."
- Concrete, visual metaphor: "that secretary from old movies... But in my pocket"
- Repetition for emotional weight: "Years of the same pattern. Years of lost opportunities"
- Single-line paragraph as punch: "A pocket writer."
- Direct reader address to shift from story to invitation: "If you have ideas trapped like I did..."

**Closing**: Transitions from personal story to direct invitation. Not a lecture—a hand extended. CTA is personal and specific, not generic. Ends with connection, not summary.

#### Reference Fragments

**Opening with credibility + vulnerability**:
> I've been in tech for 15 years. Built products used by thousands. But here's my secret: I can't write.
>
> Not false modesty. Real fear.

**Storytelling with concrete imagery + one-liner punch**:
> Now I have what I always imagined: that secretary from old movies, sitting at a desk typing everything the boss dictates. But in my pocket. Available while I walk, while I cook, while ideas hit me at 3am.
>
> I give it my raw ideas (redundant, messy, visceral), and it turns them into something publishable.
>
> A pocket writer.

**Closing with direct invitation**:
> If you have ideas trapped like I did, waiting for the day you "learn to write"… let me tell you: with a simple setup on your phone and Claude Code, you can start now. No fear.
