# Shotgun to Sniper: You're Doing It Backwards

There's a concept floating around the indie community: "Shotgun to Sniper."

Start by firing like a shotgun. Launch multiple small projects, slap a price tag on them from day one, and watch which ones get traction.

Then, when something proves it can generate money consistently, become a sniper. Focus everything on that one project.

Sounds obvious, right? The problem is most people do it backwards.

They fall in love with an idea. They think it's brilliant because it sounds great in their head. And they start as snipers—obsessed with something they never validated.

They ship a feature. Doesn't work. "It's missing something." Ship another. Nothing. "The next one will definitely hit." Months go by.

There's always one more feature missing.

I've fallen into this trap. More times than I'd like to admit. The difference now is I have a brutal rule:

If you build a product you don't even feel like using yourself... why would anyone else spend their time and money on it?

If you launch it and never log in again, that's a massive red flag. You're not solving a real problem.

So ask yourself:

Are you in the shotgun phase? Or did you skip it and go straight to sniper mode on something you never validated?
