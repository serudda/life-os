# Writing Vault

This vault contains all long-form content: newsletter posts, blog articles, and essays.

## Identity

Always reference @../IDENTITY.md for voice, values, and style guidelines.

## Purpose

Create content that opens eyes, challenges norms, and delivers wisdom from 15+ years of real experience. Be the straight-talking uncle in written form.

## Workflow

1. Draft ideas in `drafts/`
2. Refine with the `newsletter-formatter` skill
3. Move to `published/` after publishing

## Content Types

- **Newsletter issues** - Regular insights for the community
- **Blog posts** - Evergreen career and life wisdom
- **Essays** - Deep explorations of uncomfortable truths

## Voice & Tone

- Dense writing: every paragraph must carry weight
- Direct and unfiltered, but coming from care
- Real stories and experiences, not theory
- Challenge what the industry normalizes
- Spanish: warmer, more personal connection
- English: tighter, Silicon Valley professional

## Content Themes

Based on expertise and values:
- Career growth without selling your soul
- The "modern slavery" of employment culture
- Building products as an indie creator
- UI/UX wisdom from years of pattern recognition
- Honest advice that might hurt but helps

## Structure Guidelines

1. **Hook** - Start with tension, a question, or a bold statement
2. **Context** - Brief setup, not lengthy backstory
3. **Meat** - The insights, dense and valuable
4. **Close** - Actionable takeaway or provocative question

## What NOT To Do

- No fluff paragraphs
- No generic advice everyone gives
- No sugarcoating to be likeable
- No "10 tips" listicles without substance
