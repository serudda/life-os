## The Content Pipeline

Creating a post follows a clear pipeline. Each phase has its own skill:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   IDEA/FRAGMENT ──► CONTENT-INTERVIEW ──► POST-BUILDER ──► PUBLISHED
│                           │                    │                │
│                           ▼                    ▼                │
│                      Interview Doc        Draft V1              │
│                    (Q&A structured)    (Ready to review)        │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 1: Content Interview
**Skill**: `content-interview`
**Input**: Raw idea, fragment, notes, anything
**Output**: Structured Q&A document in `drafts/interviews/`

The interview extracts:
- Central idea in one sentence
- Target audience
- Personal story that anchors it
- Why it matters emotionally
- Key points and raw quotes

### Phase 2: Post Builder
**Skill**: `post-builder` (pending)
**Input**: Interview document
**Output**: Draft V1 in `drafts/`

Transforms the interview material into a structured post following the handbook guidelines.

### Phase 3: Formatting (Optional)
**Skill**: `newsletter-formatter`
**Input**: Draft needing polish
**Output**: Final formatted version

For when you have content that just needs final touches.

## Core Principles (Never Change)

1. **Every paragraph earns its place** - No filler
2. **Real experience > generic advice** - 15+ years of stories
3. **Challenge what everyone accepts** - Question normalized behaviors
4. **Specifics over abstractions** - Names, numbers, situations
5. **His ideas, organized by AI** - Extract, never generate

---

## Content Themes (From Expertise)

- Career growth without selling your soul
- The "modern slavery" of employment culture
- Indie hacking and building products
- UI/UX wisdom from pattern recognition
- Salary negotiation and knowing your worth
- Adapting to AI without losing yourself

---

## Voice by Language

**Spanish:**
- Warmer, conversational
- Natural interjections: "Mira," "Te lo digo claro,"
- Still dense, but with warmth

**English:**
- Tighter, aphoristic
- Naval/PG influence
- Clarity over warmth

---

## What NOT To Do

- No fluff paragraphs
- No generic advice everyone gives
- No sugarcoating to be likeable
- No "10 tips" listicles without substance
- No AI-generated ideas—only AI-organized ideas
