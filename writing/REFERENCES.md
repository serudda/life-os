## 1. Skills in the 21st Century

### Writing Patterns

**Opening**: Enters directly into the current debate without generic intros. Builds tension by naming the fear ("existential dread") before offering his counter-thesis. Anchors with concrete examples immediately (Boris Cherny, Claude Code, engineers running dozens of agents).

**Structure**: Fear/problem → counter-thesis → historical precedent → concrete examples → future implications. Each section answers the objection the reader would have at that moment. Uses subheadings to organize long-form without losing flow.

**Rhythm**: Mix of short and developed sentences. Paragraphs of 4-8 sentences. Uses lists within prose (not formal bullets) to enumerate tasks. After explaining something dense, drops a short punchy sentence.

**Techniques**:

- Historical analogies (1982 movie The Verdict, lawyers over decades)
- Quotes from respected figures to reinforce points (Sam Altman, Max Levchin, Dylan Field)
- Concrete examples from his own company (Box solutions engineers)
- Counterintuitive framing (skills are MORE valuable, not less)
- Anticipates reader objections ("Now, you may be wondering...")
- Specific data points (400,000 attorneys in 1975 → 1,375,000 in 2025)

**Closing**: Ends with aspirational, optimistic note. Uses superlatives ("greatest time in history"). Final paragraph synthesizes everything in 3 sentences. Last line is memorable and punchy.

### Reference Fragments

**Opening with concrete examples to anchor context**:

> Even Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, noted that 100% of his contributed code was written by Claude in the past 30 days in late December. And we're seeing countless examples of engineers that are running up to dozens of agents in parallel, all handling different parts of a project, swiftly jumping between the work of each one, doing the equivalent of weeks of engineering work in hours or a couple of days.

**Historical analogy to make abstract point tangible**:

> There's a scene in the 1982 movie The Verdict where Paul Newman and Jack Warden's characters are combing through volumes of legal books for hours while doing research for an upcoming trial. You can just feel from watching the scene how long and tedious this process once was. Just a few years later, a lawyer would have pulled up a computer and retrieved the same data nearly instantly.

**Using quotes from others to reinforce + short follow-up punch**:

> Max Levchin said it best just this week: "just as today we think of codegen AI as a 10x productivity multiplier for CS degrees (or equivalent), in a year or two we will be thinking of CS degrees as 10x productivity multipliers over codegen AI."
>
> You can replace "CS" and "codegen" for any skill and see the same effect.

**Aspirational imagery with famous names**:

> Right now, the next Zuckerberg is getting into coding for the first time because of AI. The next George Lucas is someone developing AI worlds that have never been seen before, and producing a level of entertainment that would not have been possible even a couple of years ago without tens of millions of dollars. The same will be true in life sciences, finance, and every other technical field out there.

**Final punch closing**:

> This is the greatest time in history if you're curious, resourceful, and are fundamentally want to learn and pick up new skills. Skills don't go away in the 21st century with AI. The leverage you get from them have only gone up.
