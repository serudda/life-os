- **Cultural context**: [Details affecting clothing, architecture, objects. E.g., "Urban American middle class", "Traditional rural Japan"]

Describe every character that appears in the story. Minimum: name, approximate age, 3 physical traits.

### Main Character

- **Name/Role**:
- **Approximate age**:
- **Physical description**: [Hair, build, distinguishing features]
- **Default clothing**: [If not defined, the skill will infer and keep it fixed]

### Supporting Character 1

## 3. Visual Style (\*)

- **Graphic style (text description)**: [E.g., "Realistic digital illustration with warm tones", "Soft diffused watercolor", "Anime with clean lines", "American comic with hard shadows"]
- **Visual reference**: [If you have a style reference image, describe it here. E.g., "Attached image: digital illustration with earth-tone palette, soft strokes, cinematic lighting"]

> Note: The actual style image goes directly to Whisk. Here we only need the text description to calibrate prompt language.

## 4. Output Format (\*)

- **Aspect ratio**: [16:9 (horizontal/cinema) / 9:16 (vertical/stories) / 1:1 (square)]

## 5. Reference Image Status

- **Main character reference image ready?**: [Yes / No / Plan to create before]
- **Supporting characters reference images ready?**: [Yes / No / Only some: ___]

> This matters because it changes prompt strategy:
>
> - If you HAVE the image → prompt focuses on action and pose (Whisk already knows the face).
> - If you DON'T have it → prompt includes more physical description for scene coherence.
