Loose painterly illustration built from visible, rough brush strokes.
Form defined by gesture and tonal values, not clean outlines.
Broken, unfinished edges where figure and background merge.
Imprecise anatomy, expressive proportions.
Dry-brush texture, raw paint feeling, low fidelity rendering.
Muted, limited tonal palette, atmospheric and moody.
Painting process visible, imperfect, human, expressive.

No clean outlines, no sharp edges, no polished illustration,
no graphic style, no high-detail rendering,
no solid silhouette, no concept-art cleanliness.

All human figures are suggested rather than fully defined.
Faces partially obscured, minimal facial detail.
Clothing indicated through brush strokes, not seams.
Figures feel fragile, imperfect, partially dissolving.
