## Language & Interaction Protocol

- **System Language:** All internal documentation, skill definitions, and logic must remain in English.

- **Interaction Language:** Always communicate with Sergio in Spanish. All questions, confirmations, and feedback must be delivered in Spanish.

- **Content Preservation:** Maintain the original language of any provided source material (tweets, book fragments, quotes) by default.

- **Translation Check:** If the source material is in a language different from the intended output (e.g., an English tweet for a Spanish draft), you must ask: "¿Deseas mantener el idioma original o prefieres traducirlo al español para desarrollar la idea?"

- **Output Consistency:** Do not mix languages within a single response. Technical terms can remain in English if necessary, but the prose must be cohesive.
